Virtual Stock Trading App
A virtual stock trading app allows users to simulate trading in the stock market without real
financial risk. Users can create virtual portfolios, buy and sell stocks based on live market data,
and analyze performance with detailed charts and metrics. The platform includes features like
tutorials on stock trading, mock trading competitions, and real-time news updates, making it an
educational tool for aspiring investors.
The stock market can be intimidating for beginners. Our team is developing a Virtual Stock Trading App to make learning stock trading engaging, risk-free, and interactive. To understand our target audience better, we conducted a survey, and the results have provided valuable insights that will guide our development.

About Our Project
Our Virtual Stock Trading App is designed as a beginner-friendly and gamified learning platform that allows users to experience the stock market without financial risk. The app will enable users to:

Simulate real-time trading with virtual currency.
Track and analyze stock market performance using real-time data.
Learn through interactive tutorials and quizzes tailored to different experience levels.
Participate in mock trading competitions to test and refine their strategies.
Receive AI-driven insights and recommendations to understand market trends better.

We envision this platform as a bridge between theory and real-world trading, helping users gain confidence before they enter live markets.
